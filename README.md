The first step was basically to perform a local clone of the file from the repository mentioned above in line #9.

Once this was done, we were able to create a docker image by using the steps 3-4 in the link below:
https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360035638032-Publish-a-Docker-container-image-to-Google-Container-Registry-GCR-

Once this is done, we were able to upload that image to the Google Cloud Container Registry service. Once done, we deployed this using the Google Kubernetes Engine.

The external IP for the project was: http://34.29.126.10/

Finally, we uploaded everything to this repository in Github and created the log files.

Thank you
